We are currently trying to improve the documentation in various places and a website should serve as a starting point.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to be done here.\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/news/new-website/","title":"New website"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/news/release-021/":{"body":"Linfa 0.2.1 amends changes to the feature system, which made it impossible to release 0.2.0 on crates.io.\nChanges\n\nUse openblas-system backend for now\nFill up missing information in algorithm descriptions\n\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/news/release-021/","title":"Release 0.2.1"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/news/release-030/":{"body":"Linfa 0.3.0 concentrates on polishing the existing implementation and adds only three new algorithms to the crowd. A new feature system is introduced, which allows the selection of the BLAS/LAPACK backend in the base-crate. The Dataset interface is polished and follows the ndarray model more closely. The new linfa-datasets crate gives easier access to sample datasets and can be used for testing.\nNew algorithms\n\nApproximated DBSCAN has been added to linfa-clustering by [@Sauro98]\nGaussian Naive Bayes  has been added to linfa-bayes by [@VasanthakumarV]\nElastic Net linear regression has been added to linfa-elasticnet by [@paulkoerbitz] and [@bytesnake]\n\nChanges\n\nAdded benchmark to gaussian mixture models (a3eede55)\nFixed bugs in linear decision trees, added generator for TiKZ trees (bfa5aebe7)\nImplemented serde for all crates behind feature flag (4f0b63bb)\nImplemented new backend features (7296c9ec4)\nIntroduced linfa-datasets for easier testing (3cec12b4f)\nRename Dataset to DatasetBase and introduce Dataset and DatasetView (21dd579cf)\nImprove kernel tests and documentation (8e81a6d)\n\nExample\nThe following section shows a small example how datasets interact with the training and testing of a Linear Decision Tree. \nYou can load a dataset, shuffle it and then split it into training and validation sets:\n// initialize pseudo random number generator with seed 42\nlet mut rng = Isaac64Rng::seed_from_u64(42);\n// load the Iris dataset, shuffle and split with ratio 0.8\nlet (train, test) = linfa_datasets::iris()\n    .shuffle(&amp;mut rng)\n    .split_with_ratio(0.8);\n\nWith the training dataset a linear decision tree model can be trained. Entropy is used as a metric for the optimal split here:\nlet entropy_model = DecisionTree::params()\n    .split_quality(SplitQuality::Entropy)\n    .max_depth(Some(100))\n    .min_weight_split(10.0)\n    .min_weight_leaf(10.0)\n    .fit(&amp;train);\n\nThe validation dataset is now used to estimate the error. For this the true labels are predicted and then a confusion matrix gives clue about the type of error:\nlet cm = entropy_model\n    .predict(test.records().view())\n    .confusion_matrix(&amp;test);\n\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", cm);\n\nprintln!(\n    \"Test accuracy with Entropy criterion: {:.2}%\",\n    100.0 * cm.accuracy()\n);\n\nFinally you can analyze which features were used in the decision and export the whole tree it to a TeX file. It will contain a TiKZ tree with information on the splitting decision and impurity improvement:\nlet feats = entropy_model.features();\nprintln!(\"Features trained in this tree {:?}\", feats);\n\nlet mut tikz = File::create(\"decision_tree_example.tex\").unwrap();\ntikz.write(gini_model.export_to_tikz().to_string().as_bytes())\n    .unwrap();\n\nThe whole example can be found in linfa-trees/examples/decision_tree.rs.\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/news/release-030/","title":"Release 0.3.0"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/snippets/":{"body":"","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/snippets/","title":"Snippets"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/linfa/snippets/cross-validation/":{"body":"// perform cross-validation with the F1 score\nlet f1_runs = dataset\n    .iter_fold(8, |v| params.fit(&amp;v).unwrap())\n    .map(|(model, valid)| {\n        let cm = model\n            .predict(&amp;valid)\n            .mapv(|x| x &gt;
